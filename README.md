# ErisOS

**ErisOS** is a small, bare-metal operating system for the x86 architecture, written in C. It is built as a learning project to explore low-level systems programming, bootloaders, and kernel development.

This kernel currently uses GRUB as its bootloader and prints basic status messages to the VGA text buffer in color. Over time, ErisOS will gain more features such as a scrolling terminal, input handling, and memory management.

---

## ðŸ§° Requirements

- **GCC** cross-compiler for i386 (`i386-elf-gcc`)
- **GNU Assembler** (for assembly files)
- **GRUB tools** (`grub-mkrescue`)
- **QEMU** (or any other emulator for testing)

You can install QEMU and GRUB using your distro's package manager.  
For the cross-compiler and assembler, see [OSDev Wiki: GCC Cross-Compiler](https://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler).

## Build Instructions

To compile ErisOS and run it in QEMU:

```
make
make run
```

To clean the build:

```
make clean
```

To manually check if your kernel is multiboot-compliant:

```
./multiboot-checker.sh
```

---

## Planned features

- Text wrapping and terminal scrolling
- Keyboard input
- Interrupt descriptor table (IDT)
- Programmable interrupt timer (PIT)
- Paging memory map parsing
